The purpose of the new analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the city type, and the total weekly fares for each city type’s ride-sharing data while using Pandas and Matplotlib. In addition, we’ll have to present a summary of how the data differs by city type to the decision-makers at Pyber.

## Summary:

Throughout our analysis we have determine that we can provide these 3 recommendations to Pyber’s CEO.

- Increase the drivers in our Rural areas, as it is proven that category is the most profitable.

- Increase the price of urban rides, as it is very possible, they are much     shorter.

- Charge $5.00 flat fee for the first mile and charge $0.75 per every additional mile, as it will guarantee our drivers the rides are worth their time.
